# ‚úÖ CrewAI Debug Assignment Fix Summary

This document outlines all the fixes made to get the Blood Test Report Analyzer system (using CrewAI) working correctly.

---

## 1. üõ†Ô∏è Tools Code (`tools.py`) Fixes

### ‚úÖ Problem 1: Async Method Inconsistency

- **Issue**: CrewAI tools expect synchronous methods.
- **Fix**: Removed `async` from all `_run()` methods.

### ‚úÖ Problem 2: Tool Inheritance Missing

- **Issue**: Custom tools were not inheriting from `BaseTool`.
- **Fix**: Made `BloodTestReportTool`, `NutritionTool`, and `ExerciseTool` inherit from `BaseTool`.

### ‚úÖ Problem 3: Incorrect Method Names

- **Issue**: Methods were named arbitrarily like `analyze_nutrition_tool()`.
- **Fix**: Renamed all to `_run()` which CrewAI expects.

### ‚úÖ Problem 4: Tool Parameter Handling

- **Issue**: Custom parameters were not being parsed correctly.
- **Fix**: Changed method signature to `_run(self, **kwargs)`.

### ‚úÖ Problem 5: File Path and Error Handling

- **Issue**: Default path was overly nested and lacked error handling.
- **Fix**: Set path to `data/sample.pdf` and added checks for file existence.

### ‚úÖ Problem 6: Tool Descriptions

- **Issue**: Descriptions were vague or missing.
- **Fix**: Updated all tool descriptions for clarity and proper UI display.

## 2. üìã Tasks Code (`task.py`) Fixes

### ‚úÖ Problem 7: Dangerous and Unethical Prompts

- **Issue**: Tasks encouraged fabricated or unsafe outputs.
- **Fix**: Rewrote tasks to be professional, medically accurate, and evidence-based.

### ‚úÖ Problem 8: Unused Search Tool

- **Issue**: `search_tool` was imported but never used.
- **Fix**: Integrated `search_tool` into research-oriented tasks.

### ‚úÖ Problem 9: Wrong Agent Assignment

- **Issue**: Task used incorrect agent (e.g. verifier task run by doctor).
- **Fix**: Assigned appropriate agents to each task.

---

## 3. üåê FastAPI Code (`app.py`) Fixes

### ‚úÖ Problem 10: File Path Not Communicated

- **Issue**: Uploaded file path was not passed to the Crew.
- **Fix**: Updated task description or state to include file path for accurate tool execution.
